Bascially 4 steps:
 1. TCH Handshake
 2. Certificate Check, one thing that's worth mentioning, is the client needs to know the server is who it says it is, they both need to have a trusted authority, the client is interacting with the actual owner of the domain.
 3. Key Exchange, public and private keys.
 4. Data Transmission
